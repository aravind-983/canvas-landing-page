# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements navigation functionality for "Request Demo" buttons throughout the application to automatically scroll to the form section in the details section of the landing page. This provides a seamless user experience by directing users to the contact form when they express interest in requesting a demo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing any page of the application, I want to click on "Request Demo" buttons and be taken directly to the contact form, so that I can easily request a demo without having to manually find the form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any "Request Demo" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the landing page and scroll to the form section in the details section
2. WHEN the user is already on the landing page and clicks "Request Demo" THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the form section without page reload
3. WHEN the user is on a different page and clicks "Request Demo" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the landing page first and then scroll to the form section
4. WHEN the scroll animation occurs THEN the system SHALL use smooth scrolling behavior for better user experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Request Demo" button functionality to work consistently across all pages, so that I have a predictable experience regardless of where I encounter the button.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Request Demo" buttons exist on the Header component THEN they SHALL navigate to the form section
2. WHEN "Request Demo" buttons exist on the About page THEN they SHALL navigate to the form section
3. WHEN "Request Demo" buttons exist on the Monetize page THEN they SHALL navigate to the form section
4. WHEN "Request Demo" buttons exist on any other page THEN they SHALL navigate to the form section
5. WHEN the form section is reached THEN the system SHALL ensure the form is visible and properly positioned in the viewport

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation functionality to be reusable and maintainable, so that adding new "Request Demo" buttons is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the navigation functionality THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable function or hook for "Request Demo" navigation
2. WHEN a new "Request Demo" button is added THEN it SHALL be able to use the same navigation functionality without code duplication
3. WHEN the form section ID or location changes THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes to update all navigation references
4. WHEN the navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL handle both React Router navigation and DOM scrolling appropriately
