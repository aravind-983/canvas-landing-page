# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the MonetizePage work section by replacing static images with interactive video content and implementing sophisticated hover effects similar to the ProductSection. The enhancement will create a more engaging user experience while maintaining full responsiveness across all device sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the MonetizePage work section, I want to see videos instead of static images in the work step cards, so that I can better understand each step through dynamic visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MonetizePage work section loads THEN the system SHALL display videos instead of static images for all four work step cards
2. WHEN a video is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the video auto-plays, loops, and is muted by default
3. WHEN the video loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the same aspect ratio and positioning as the original images
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL use the provided video assets: "Cue points.mov", "Trigger Smart Interactions.mov", "Capture first party data.mov", and "Drive revenue & Insights.mp4"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the work section, I want sophisticated hover effects on the work step cards, so that I can have an engaging and interactive experience similar to the product section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a work step card THEN the system SHALL scale the card up by 8% and lift it vertically by 8px
2. WHEN I hover over a work step card THEN the system SHALL scale the video within the card by 15% for a magnification effect
3. WHEN I hover over a work step card THEN the system SHALL apply enhanced shadow effects (0 20px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25))
4. WHEN I hover over a work step card THEN the system SHALL apply a background overlay with blur effect to other content
5. WHEN I hover over a work step card THEN the system SHALL reduce opacity of other cards to 70% and scale them down to 95%
6. WHEN I stop hovering THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition all effects back to normal state
7. WHEN hovering occurs THEN the system SHALL use cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing for smooth transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the video hover effects to work properly across all screen sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (>768px) THEN the system SHALL apply full hover effects as specified
2. WHEN viewing on tablet (≤768px) THEN the system SHALL reduce hover scale to 5% and vertical lift to 4px
3. WHEN viewing on mobile (≤480px) THEN the system SHALL reduce hover scale to 3% and vertical lift to 2px
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL reduce backdrop blur from 8px to 4px
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain video aspect ratios and card layouts
6. WHEN on touch devices THEN the system SHALL ensure hover effects work properly with touch interactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want the video implementation to follow best practices, so that the feature is performant and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper video attributes: autoPlay, loop, muted, playsInline
2. WHEN videos are loaded THEN the system SHALL disable picture-in-picture and download controls
3. WHEN videos are displayed THEN the system SHALL use object-fit: cover for consistent sizing
4. WHEN implementing hover effects THEN the system SHALL reuse CSS patterns from ProductSection for consistency
5. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing scroll animation functionality
6. WHEN videos fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback handling
