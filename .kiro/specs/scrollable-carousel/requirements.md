# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing carousel component by adding scrollable functionality to the content boxes. Instead of relying solely on automatic fade transitions, users will be able to manually scroll through the carousel content using touch gestures on mobile devices and mouse interactions on desktop. This improvement will provide better user control and engagement with the carousel content while maintaining the existing visual design and automatic rotation functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to scroll through carousel content manually, so that I can control the pace of viewing and revisit content of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a swipe gesture on mobile devices THEN the carousel SHALL transition to the next or previous slide based on swipe direction
2. WHEN a user performs a horizontal scroll action on desktop THEN the carousel SHALL transition between slides smoothly
3. WHEN a user scrolls to change slides THEN the automatic rotation timer SHALL reset to prevent immediate auto-advance
4. WHEN the carousel reaches the last slide and user scrolls forward THEN the carousel SHALL loop back to the first slide
5. WHEN the carousel is on the first slide and user scrolls backward THEN the carousel SHALL loop to the last slide

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor using a touch device, I want intuitive touch controls for the carousel, so that I can easily navigate content with familiar gestures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes left on the carousel content area THEN the carousel SHALL advance to the next slide
2. WHEN a user swipes right on the carousel content area THEN the carousel SHALL go to the previous slide
3. WHEN a swipe gesture is too short (less than 50px) THEN the carousel SHALL not change slides
4. WHEN a user performs a vertical swipe THEN the carousel SHALL not interfere with page scrolling
5. WHEN touch interactions are in progress THEN the automatic slide rotation SHALL be paused

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor using a desktop device, I want mouse-based scroll controls for the carousel, so that I can navigate content using familiar desktop interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over the carousel content area THEN visual indicators SHALL suggest scrollable functionality
2. WHEN a user performs horizontal mouse wheel scrolling over the carousel THEN the carousel SHALL transition between slides
3. WHEN a user clicks and drags horizontally on the carousel content THEN the carousel SHALL follow the drag motion
4. WHEN mouse interactions are active THEN the automatic slide rotation SHALL be paused until interaction ends
5. IF horizontal scroll is not available THEN alternative navigation controls SHALL be provided

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the scrollable carousel to maintain visual consistency, so that the enhanced functionality doesn't disrupt the existing design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrollable functionality is added THEN all existing visual elements SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN transitions occur via scrolling THEN they SHALL use the same smooth animation timing as automatic transitions
3. WHEN the carousel is in scrollable mode THEN the quote positioning and z-index SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN responsive breakpoints are active THEN scrollable functionality SHALL adapt appropriately for each screen size
5. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN scrollable controls SHALL be keyboard navigable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the scrollable carousel to work seamlessly with the existing automatic rotation, so that I have both manual control and automatic progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no user interaction occurs THEN the carousel SHALL continue automatic rotation every 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user manually scrolls THEN the automatic timer SHALL reset and resume after interaction ends
3. WHEN the carousel is paused due to user interaction THEN it SHALL resume automatic rotation after 5 seconds of inactivity
4. WHEN manual navigation occurs THEN the current slide state SHALL be properly synchronized
5. WHEN both manual and automatic transitions are possible THEN manual interactions SHALL take priority
