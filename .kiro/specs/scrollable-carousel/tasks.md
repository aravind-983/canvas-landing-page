# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up scrollable container structure and CSS foundation

  - Modify the existing carousel JSX to wrap content in a scrollable container
  - Add CSS classes for scroll-snap behavior and horizontal scrolling
  - Ensure existing visual design remains unchanged
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Implement touch event handling for mobile swipe gestures

  - Add touch event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) to the carousel component
  - Create logic to detect horizontal vs vertical swipes and prevent conflicts with page scrolling
  - Implement swipe threshold detection (minimum 50px) for slide changes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Add mouse interaction support for desktop users

  - Implement mouse wheel event handling for horizontal scrolling
  - Add click-and-drag functionality for mouse-based slide navigation
  - Create hover state indicators to suggest scrollable functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Create scroll position management and slide synchronization

  - Implement scroll position tracking to determine current slide
  - Add smooth scrolling function to programmatically navigate to specific slides
  - Sync manual scroll position with existing currentSlide state
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 5. Integrate manual scrolling with automatic rotation system

  - Modify existing auto-rotation timer to pause during user interactions
  - Implement interaction timeout to resume automatic rotation after 5 seconds of inactivity
  - Ensure manual navigation properly resets the automatic timer
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Add responsive behavior and mobile optimization

  - Ensure scrollable functionality works across all existing responsive breakpoints
  - Optimize touch target sizes and scroll sensitivity for mobile devices
  - Maintain quote positioning and z-index consistency during scroll transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 7. Implement accessibility and keyboard navigation support

  - Add keyboard event handlers for arrow key navigation
  - Ensure ARIA labels and focus management work with scrollable functionality
  - Test screen reader compatibility with the enhanced carousel
  - _Requirements: 4.5_

- [x] 8. Add performance optimizations and error handling

  - Implement throttled scroll event handlers using requestAnimationFrame
  - Add feature detection for CSS scroll-snap with graceful degradation
  - Create proper cleanup for event listeners in useEffect hooks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 9. Create comprehensive tests for scrollable functionality

  - Write unit tests for touch gesture detection and scroll position calculations
  - Add integration tests for interaction between manual and automatic modes
  - Test cross-browser compatibility and responsive behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_
